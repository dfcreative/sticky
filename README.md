Makes any element fixed when itâ€™s been scrolled on.
Same as [Sticky JS](http://stickyjs.com/), but easier and with no bugs of margin/padding.
Use: add class `fluid-fixed` to a target element.

## TODO

* Find out is it possible to control animations or some set of properties by scroll, not by animation keyframes through CSS.
* Think how to call: not fluid-fixed, probably.


## Theoretical syntax

* {
	to: {set of props},
	easing: null or easing-function
}
