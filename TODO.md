* Make sticky bottom
* Smoother rendering of stick

* Make animations for mutually exclusive

* Test prev items deletion (delete event)

* Test IE8 empty dataset

* Test prev item hiding

* Make mode within stacks

* Fix two-stack behaviour: stack, that is lower, should continue movement as if it is in exclusive mode with top element (pre-sticky). Now it saves a gap, not sticking to the top.
